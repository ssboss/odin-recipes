        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Latkes (potato pancakes) are a must-have at Hanukkah, but are really wonderful any time of the year! This is my mother's recipe, which is honestly the best potato latke I've had. I usually end up making a second batch because they disappear so quickly. I've tried other recipes and always return to this one. Lovely topped with sour cream or applesauce.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups shredded potato</li>
            <li>1/4 grated onion</li>

            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine potato, onion, crushed crackers, eggs, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl.</li>

            <li>Drop spoonfuls of potato mixture, first pressing mixture against side of the bowl to remove excess liquid, into hot oil; slightly flatten latkes with the back of a spoon to make an even thickness.</li>
